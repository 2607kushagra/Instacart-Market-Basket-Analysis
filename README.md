This project utilized Market Basket Analysis to analyze customer purchase patterns and
frequently purchased items, with the goal of helping Instacart maintain sufficient
product inventory and facilitate reordering. The team performed K means clustering to
identify customer clusters and subgroups with comparable purchasing behaviors, and
developed XGBoost models to predict whether a product will be reordered or not.
The Instacart Market Basket Analysis Kaggle dataset provided transactional and
purchasing details of customers, which were used to predict the next products
customers tend to purchase and whether a product is reordered or not in their next
purchase. Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into customer behavior, including
the most popular days and hours for user activity.
The predictive models developed in this project enhanced the user experience by
recommending likely products for customers to purchase during the order process. The
results and insights were utilized to enhance customer experience and increase revenue
by employing efficient segmentation and prediction models. Additionally, a proposed
marketing strategy included customized communications that highlight anticipated
products to remind customers to reorder.
Overall, this project provided valuable insights into customer behavior and purchasing
trends, which can be utilized by Instacart and other similar retailers to improve
customer experience and increase revenue.
